# As you add agents to Deep Security, they are automatically made available for download through
#   the same hostname:port as the Deep Security Manager admin interface. For Marketplace and software deployments, pass
#   this data through the 'dsm_agent_download_hostname' & 'dsm_agent_download_port' attributes.
default['deep_security_agent']['dsm_agent_download_hostname'] = 'app.deepsecurity.trendmicro.com'
default['deep_security_agent']['dsm_agent_download_port'] = 443

# For Marketplace and software deployments 'ignore_ssl_validation' must to set to 'true'
#    unless you've installed a verifiable SSL certificate.
default['deep_security_agent']['ignore_ssl_validation'] = false

# Deep Security agents activate on a different port than the admin interface. For Marketplace and
#    software deployments, 'dsm_agent_activation_hostname' is typically the same as 'dsm_agent_download_hostname'
#    but 'dsm_agent_activation_port' is different than 'dsm_agent_download_port'. For Deep Security
#    as a Service, it's the reverse to make it easy to configure only one outbound port.

default['deep_security_agent']['dsm_agent_activation_port'] = 443

# For multi-tenant deployments of Deep Security (such as Deep Security as a Service), every tenant/organization
#    is assigned a unique 'tenant_id' and 'tenant_password' that is only used for agent activation. You can
#    find this info from the Support/Help > Deployment Scripts menu in the Deep Security Manager. Select any agent
#    and then enable "Activate Agent automatically after installation". This places the tenant_id and
#    tenant_password in the script the wizard is building for you.
